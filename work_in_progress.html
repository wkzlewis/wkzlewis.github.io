    <p> <b>Towards a Hybrid Reading of Kant's Transcendental Idealism</b></p>
    My dissertation proposes a novel reading of Kant’s transcendental idealism which I call the hybrid reading. 
    Roughly put, transcendental idealism is the doctrine that the objects we can experience, or appearances, are in some way mind-dependent, and that we cannot know how things are in themselves. 
    Current interpretations of this doctrine fall into two main camps. 
    One camp of readers holds that transcendental idealism amounts to the metaphysical thesis that reality has a tiered structure: things in themselves are what is ultimately real, while appearances are less real. 
    The other camp interprets this doctrine as highlighting the conditions and boundary of human knowledge. 
    My reading steers a middle course between these two camps. As I read him, Kant’s idealism explains the nature of objects as the basic constituents of reality. 
    At the same time, however, he regards the properties that are essential to being an object as dependent on the conditions of our knowledge, namely the categories and space and time. 
    I thus read transcendental idealism as primarily concerned with providing a radically anthropocentric metaphysics: while it aims to describe the way the world is, it also regards the human conditions of knowledge as central to how we describe the world. 
    On my reading, while Kant denies that we can have any knowledge <i>(Wissen)</i> of how the world ultimately is independently of the human standpoint, he allows us to have some practically justified beliefs (<i>Glauben</i>) about how things are in themselves from the human standpoint.
